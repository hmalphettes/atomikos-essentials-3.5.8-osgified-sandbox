/**
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * A light-weight alternative for message-driven beans: the QueueReceiverSession
 * allows MessageListener instances to listen on JMS messages in a transactional
 * way (non-transactional mode is not supported). This class is implemented as a
 * JavaBean to facilitate integration in third-party frameworks. This session is
 * <b>long-lived</b> in the sense that underlying JMS resources are refreshed
 * regularly. In particular, clients should not worry about the connection or
 * session timing out. This allows this class to be used for server-type
 * applications.
 * <p>
 * <b>IMPORTANT:</b> the transactional behaviour guarantees redelivery after failures.
 * As a side-effect, this can lead to so-called <em>poison messages</em>: messages
 * whose processing repeatedly fails due to some recurring error (for instance, a primary
 * key violation in the database, a NullPointerException, ...). 
 * Poison messages are problematic
 * because they can prevent other messages from being processed, and block the system.
 * Some messaging systems
 * provide a way to deal with poison messages, others don't. In that case, it is up 
 * to the registered MessageListener to detect poison messages. The easiest way to 
 * detect these is by inspecting the <code>JMSRedelivered</code> header and/or the
 * (sometimes available) JMS property called <code>JMSXDeliveryCount</code>. For instance, if the
 * delivery count is too high then your application may choose to send the message to
 * a dedicated problem queue and thereby avoid processing errors. Whatever you do, beware
 * that messages are sometimes correctly redelivered, in particular after a prior crash of the
 * application.
 * <p>
 * <b>Instances of this class consume JMS messages in a single thread only. Use
 * QueueReceiverSessionPool if you want to have multiple concurrent threads for
 * the same queue.</b>
