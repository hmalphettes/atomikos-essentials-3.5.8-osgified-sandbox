package com.atomikos.jms;

 /**
  * 
  * 
  * A pool for topic subscribers.
  * For activating multiple threads on
  * the same topic. Upon start, an instance of this class will create a number of
  * concurrent sessions that listen for incoming messages on the same topic.
  * MessageListener instances should be thread-safe if the pool size is larger
  * than one. Note: in general, after start() any changed properties are only
  * effective on the next start() event.
  * 
  * <p>
  * <b>IMPORTANT:</b> the transactional behaviour guarantees redelivery after failures.
  * As a side-effect, this can lead to so-called <em>poison messages</em>: messages
  * whose processing repeatedly fails due to some recurring error (for instance, a primary
  * key violation in the database, a NullPointerException, ...). Poison messages are problematic
  * because they can prevent other messages from being processed, and block the system.
  * Some messaging systems
  * provide a way to deal with poison messages, others don't. In that case, it is up 
  * to the registered MessageListener to detect poison messages. The easiest way to 
  * detect these is by inspecting the <code>JMSRedelivered</code> header and/or the
  * (sometimes available) JMS property called <code>JMSXDeliveryCount</code>. For instance, if the
  * delivery count is too high then your application may choose to send the message to
  * a dedicated problem queue and thereby avoid processing errors. Whatever you do, beware
  * that messages are sometimes correctly redelivered, in particular after a prior crash of the
  * application.
