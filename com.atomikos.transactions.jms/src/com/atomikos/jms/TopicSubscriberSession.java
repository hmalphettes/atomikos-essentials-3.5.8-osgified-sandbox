/**
* 
* 
* A light-weight alternative for message-driven beans: the TopicReceiverSession
* allows MessageListener instances to listen on JMS messages in a transactional
* way (non-transactional mode is not supported). This class is implemented as a
* JavaBean to facilitate integration in third-party frameworks. This session is
* <b>long-lived</b> in the sense that underlying JMS resources are refreshed
* regularly. In particular, clients should not worry about the connection or
* session timing out. This allows this class to be used for server-type
* applications.
* <p>
* <b>IMPORTANT:</b> the transactional behaviour guarantees redelivery after failures.
* As a side-effect, this can lead to so-called <em>poison messages</em>: messages
* whose processing repeatedly fails due to some recurring error (for instance, a primary
* key violation in the database, a NullPointerException, ...). Poison messages are problematic
* because they can prevent other messages from being processed, and block the system.
* Some messaging systems
* provide a way to deal with poison messages, others don't. In that case, it is up 
* to the registered MessageListener to detect poison messages. The easiest way to 
* detect these is by inspecting the <code>JMSRedelivered</code> header and/or the
* (sometimes available) JMS property called <code>JMSXDeliveryCount</code>. For instance, if the
* delivery count is too high then your application may choose to send the message to
* a dedicated problem queue and thereby avoid processing errors. Whatever you do, beware
* that messages are sometimes correctly redelivered, in particular after a prior crash of the
* application.
* <p>
* <b>
* Instances of this class consume JMS messages in a single thread only. Use
* TopicReceiverSessionPool if you want to have multiple concurrent threads for
* the same topic.
* </b>
