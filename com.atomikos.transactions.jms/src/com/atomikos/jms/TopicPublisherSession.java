 /**
  * 
  * 
  * 
  * This is a <b>long-lived</b> topic sender session, representing a
  * self-refreshing JMS session that can be used to send JMS messages in a
  * transactional way. The client code does not have to worry about refreshing or
  * closing JMS objects explicitly: this is all handled in this class. All the
  * client needs to do is indicate when it wants to start or stop using the
  * session.
  * <p>
  * Note that instances are not meant for concurrent use by different threads:
  * each thread should use a private instance instead.
  * <p>
  * <b>Important: if you change any properties AFTER sending on the session, then
  * you will need to explicitly stop and restart the session to have the changes
  * take effect!</b>
  * 
  * <p>
