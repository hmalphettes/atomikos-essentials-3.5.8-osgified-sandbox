/**
 * This is a <b>long-lived</b> JMS sender session, representing a
 * self-refreshing JMS session that can be used to send JMS messages in a
 * transacted way (a JTA transaction context is required). 
 * 
 * The client code does not have to worry about refreshing or
 * closing JMS objects explicitly: this is all handled in this class. All the
 * client needs to do is indicate when it wants to start or stop using the
 * session.
 * <p>
 * This class produces instances for concurrent use by different threads:
 * threaded applications can share one instance.
 * <p>
 * <b>Important: if you change any properties AFTER sending on the session, then
 * you will need to explicitly stop and restart the session to have the changes
 * take effect!</b>
