 * A thread class for subtransaction threads. A SubTxThread is a thread whose
 * code is automatically executed in a subtransaction of the calling thread's
 * transaction. Creation, start and end of the subtransaction is done by the
 * system so the programmer does not have to worry about that. To create a new
 * instance, you need a <a href="Waiter.html">Waiter</a> and a <a
 * href="SubTxCode.html">SubTxCode</a> instance.
