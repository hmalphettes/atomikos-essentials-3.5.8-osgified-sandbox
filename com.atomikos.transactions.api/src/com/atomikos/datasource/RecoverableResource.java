  *
  *A Recoverable Resource is the abstraction of a resource 
  *that supports recoverable work (i.e., that supports Participant
  *instances). Its primary use is for Participant instances that are
  *not self-containing, as for instance in XA transactions
  *(where the Participant can not contain the entire transaction
  *context of the server, but only an external reference to it in the
  *form of an Xid instance).
  *A recoverable resource is invoked at recovery time by its
  *own Participant instances (typically in the readExternal 
  *method), who iteratively ask each resource 
  *in the com.atomikos.icatch.Configuration whether or not they 
  *can be recovered by them. At the end of recovery, 
  *the TM will invoke the endRecovery method, to indicate to the
  *resource that whatever private logs it has, any remaining 
  *and non-recovered participants should be aborted.
