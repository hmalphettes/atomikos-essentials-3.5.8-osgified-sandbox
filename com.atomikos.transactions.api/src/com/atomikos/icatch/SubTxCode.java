 * the calling thread's transaction. Implementations do NOT need to create,
 * start or commit/rollback these subtransactions: all management is done by the
 * system.
 * 
 * NOTE: in case of a top-level transaction in preferred serial mode, the
 * subtransactional threads will be serialized with respect to each other.

     * an exception, then the subtransaction will be committed.
