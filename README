atomikos-essentials transaction manager version 3.5.8 repackaged and tweaked for OSGi
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a friendly fork of atomikos-essentials-3.5.8 to work on making the open-source transaction manager support OSGi.
The sources have been first generated using the goal "sources" of the build.xml file.
Then a new eclipse PDE plugin project was created for each one of the *-sources.jar
Then the MANIFEST.MF of each of the plugin was edited to compile correctly.
All other dependencies we imported as OSGi bundles through the PDE.
They were found on spring's maven repository of OSGi bundles:
http://www.springsource.com/repository/app/

This a work in progress.


Bug: each MANIFEST.MF has the entry:
"Bundle-ClassPath: bin/,."
This is a workaround not sure why it was needed for me but it must not be used one the jars are actually built.
