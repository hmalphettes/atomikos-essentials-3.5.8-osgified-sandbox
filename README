atomikos-essentials transaction manager version 3.5.8 repackaged and tweaked for OSGi
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a friendly fork of atomikos-essentials-3.5.8 to work on making the open-source transaction manager support OSGi.
Here is how this project was created:
- register on http://atomikos.com
- download the sources.
- modify the build.xml file found there.
- call the new target "sources" in the build.xml file of the downloaded atomikos sources.
- make a new eclipse PDE plugin project for each one of the *-sources.jar
- edit the MANIFEST.MF of each of the plugin till it compiles correctly.
All required external dependencies we imported as OSGi bundles through the PDE.
They were found on spring's maven repository of OSGi bundles:
http://www.springsource.com/repository/app/

This a work in progress:
- the hibernate plugins have not been processed that way yet.
- the jms bundle has not been tested.
- in fact this has been tested with one test-case: http://github.com/intalio/hightide-on-osgi/blob/master/org.eclipse.jetty.hightide.testjndi/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF


Bug:
----
each MANIFEST.MF has the entry:
"Bundle-ClassPath: bin/,."
This is a workaround not sure why it was needed for me but it must not be used one the jars are actually built.
